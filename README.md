# NoPS - NotPsxSerial
Feb 2020 - github.com/JonathanDotCel

This is the PC-side companion to Unirom8 with backwards compat for Unirom7/PSXSerial format.

# GPL BEER LICENSE.
It's the same as the GPL3, but if you fork it, you must send me a beer and leave the original headers.
As an addition, only add credits; never remove.


# Upgrading to UniROM:
    
   Specific instructions for doing that can be found in the Unirom Download,
   on PSXDev.net or on the unirom github at github.com/JonathanDotCel

# Running the example:  

    Example:
      The hello world test executable was written by Matthew Read / Shadow of PSXDev.net.
      To run it:
      nops /exe psx_helloworld.exe COM8

# A slightly more awkward thanks:
      While NoPS has been re-written from the ground up for Unirom 8, before that it was
      a decompiled version of Matthew's PSXSerial with the header changed to reflect that.
      (Or more specifically to deny that). In keeping with what I've just decided is tradition,
      we're going with the same motif.
